Swiggy,2,2025-10-02 11:25:39,230,Favourites button is hidden inside a very hard to access menu button (within the restaurant screen). Accidentally pressing the group order button. But why? when there's so much space!!!
Swiggy,1,2025-10-05 16:28:33,229,"Came here to give a 1 star review to Swiggy after my order was cancelled 45 MINUTES AFTER PLACING IT! But I found I had already left a 1 star review 3 years ago. 10 PM, most of the restaurants are closed or closing. And they waited this long to cancel my order. Get your act together Swiggy!"
Swiggy,1,2025-09-30 10:22:22,208,"I have had a very bad experience on swiggy, i ordered 2 items and received only one. With the missing item i didn't accept it and the customer care support called me apologised and told me that the will replace both the items within 30 minutes. But when the replaced item came again the same item was missing. I am so very disappointed with swiggy team. Such a irresponsible one! And even they have asked me to pay for the item again. What are those people doing actually. Very very disappointing."
Zomato,1,2025-10-04 06:28:51,149,"Previously, you clicked on the numbers below the rating and it would take you to the page where you can read the reviews for the particular restaurant. Now, clicking on the same, just shows a popup on how ratings are calculated. It doesn't allow you to read the reviews. They have probably tucked the review section under multiple layers of menu so that it is a hassle for the users to look up reviews. If this is how Zomato plans to proceed, I will not renew Gold and fully stop using Zomato. GTFO"
Swiggy,1,2025-09-29 15:27:33,141,"I ordered 10 items but received only 6. I had to contact support myself, and only then they informed me that the other items were not available. If the items are out of stock, why are they even allowed to be added to the cart? On top of that, the refund they initiated was for a lesser amount, saying coupons and discounts will be deducted. Absolutely pathetic experience and no accountability."
Swiggy,1,2025-09-30 18:04:37,121,"ordered from Lunchbox. waited for over an hour and then gets cancelled without any notification or updates. then the items I ordered are off the menu list. if they didn't the order available, why did they allow the item to be visible on the app and then change it after an hour. Swiggy on top of it, gives no updates, notifications nothing, just cancels it. tho it did give me a refund, but also a big embarrassment in front of the people I ordered the food for. (also it was an order for 7 people)"
Zomato,1,2025-10-02 16:51:20,11,"there is no point of whether you have gold membership or not, zomato won't care about it. I have been a gold customer from last 1 year. many times they delay a lot and in the end they cancel the order. when we complaint, they just refund. what about our time and other things. Can't trust zomato, whether they deliver or not. it's always a hit and miss."
Zomato,1,2025-10-04 07:32:27,7,"With this new update, I can no longer see delivery reviews for the food that people order for home delivery. This is nonsense, I used to write ethical reviews and it won't appear now. So all that time I wrote all the reviews is a total waste. At least add the feature that people who have saved my phone number can read my reviews. Also how would I know about the restaurant food without reading the reviews. There are outlets that sell garbage in the name of food on zomato."
Zomato,1,2025-10-05 07:39:07,6,zomaton location service is not good compare to swiggy or zomato delivery partners are lying....
Zomato,1,2025-10-01 13:38:13,6,"Fraud thugs overcharging you..Never connect your wallets and credit card details in this app. fraudulent practises being used to increase revenue. Push cart, auto checkout in billing stage if cash on pay or wallet is payment option, .Surge fees, platform fees, cancellation fees. Pricing is way higher compared to Swiggy or other platform. If you do not allow them to bully and boycott the app things will fall into its place."
